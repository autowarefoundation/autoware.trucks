## EgoLanes
Lane detection is an essential task in understanding the driving corridor for self-driving cars. Precise and accurate lane detection and road edges enables self-driving cars to remain centred in their driving corridor and track the curves of the road. To ensure safety, lane detection systems must be robust and generalisable across challenging weather conditions, lighting conditions and camera viewing/mounting angles. EgoLanes is a state-of-the-art neural network which detects all lanes and road edges on the road surface, and classifies the ego-lanes which a self-driving car should follow.
