## Contributing to open source projects
If you are new to open source projects, we recommend reading [GitHub's How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute) guide for an overview of why people contribute to open source projects, what it means to contribute and much more besides.

# How can I get help?
Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for confirmed bug reports. Instead, open a discussion in the Q&A category. For more details on the support mechanisms for Autoware, refer to the Support guidelines.

## Note

Issues created for questions or unconfirmed bugs will be moved to GitHub discussions by the maintainers.

# How can I contribute?

## Discussions
You can contribute to Autoware by facilitating and participating in [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions), such as:

- Proposing a new feature to enhance Autoware
- Joining an existing discussion and expressing your opinion
- Organizing discussions for other contributors
- Answering questions and supporting other contributors

## Join and Participate in the Privately Owned Vehicle Working group
Attend and participate in the working group meetings for the Privately Owned Vehicle Work Group. We meet every Monday in two meeting slots, and discuss current developments, new features, and other important topics related to the technical execution of this project.

There are two meeting slots which you can join, (Slot 1 is more suited for people joining from East Asia) (Slot 2 is more suited for people joining from Europe/USA). You can add the meeting invite to your calendar from these links: [Slot 1 Meeting Link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week/2024/11/18?eid=MzlmZDZvNjhjZ3FwOXZkMjc4cHZqbHBhaDhfMjAyNDExMThUMDQzMDAwWiBhdXRvd2FyZS5vcmdfNmxvbDBobzVmdDAyMTdoOGM2MHBpMWZtMzBAZw) and [Slot 2 Meeting Link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week/2024/11/18?eid=aG0yMWUzNXU1N2JxYW9wMHZkb2lncmg5bGNfMjAyNDExMThUMTYwMDAwWiBhdXRvd2FyZS5vcmdfNmxvbDBobzVmdDAyMTdoOGM2MHBpMWZtMzBAZw) - we cover the same agenda items in both slots so you only need to join one of them as best fits your schedule.


## Bug reports
Before you report a bug, please search the issue tracker for the appropriate repository. It is possible that someone has already reported the same issue and that workarounds exist. If you can't determine the appropriate repository, ask the maintainers for help by creating a new discussion in the [Q&A category](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/new?category=q-a).

When reporting a bug, you should provide a minimal set of instructions to reproduce the issue. Doing so allows us to quickly confirm and focus on the right problem.

If you want to fix the bug by yourself that will be appreciated, but you should discuss possible approaches with the maintainers in the issue before submitting a pull request.

[Creating an issue is straightforward](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository), but if you happen to experience any problems then create a Q&A discussion to ask for help.

## Pull requests
You can submit pull requests for small changes such as:

- Minor documentation updates
- Fixing spelling mistakes
- Fixing CI failures
- Fixing warnings detected by compilers or analysis tools
- Making small changes to a single package
- If your pull request is a large change, the following process should be followed:

  1 - [Create a GitHub Discussion](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/collaborating-with-maintainers-using-discussions) to propose the change. Doing so allows you to get feedback from other members and the Autoware maintainers and to ensure that the proposed change is in line with Autoware's design philosophy and current development plans. If you're not sure where to have that conversation, then [create a new Q&A discussion](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions/new?category=q-a).

  2 - [Create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) following consensus in the discussions

  3 - [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to implement the changes that references the Issue created in step 2

  4 - Create documentation for the new addition (if relevant)

Examples of large changes include:

Adding a new feature to Autoware
Adding a new documentation page or section
